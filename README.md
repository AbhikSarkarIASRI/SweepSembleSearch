SweepSembleSearch is machine learning framework for Selective Sweep prediction. This repository contains four different demographic scenario for selective sweep predictions. Each folder contains various population summary statistics data dervided directly from diploS/HIC tool through simulated data. Due to large size simulated dataset could have not been uploaded here. Still it may be provided upon request.

Along with this an R programming model that has been implmented during actual work is also attached for ease of reproducibility.

The empirical study outcome of Gallus gallus has also been attached in this repository for reference.

Further guidance if needed will be provided via direct contact.
